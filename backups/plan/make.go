// An import glob that matches nothing is no error to the adapter, only a
// warning [measured]; here it is refused. A run adapts the Caddyfile
// inside a view that holds its directory and nothing else, where a glob
// reaching outside matches nothing — and so does one through a
// directory the run's account may not list, or a link out — and the
// apps declared there would simply not be in the plan. The adapter's
// own warning is exact where a reading of the Caddyfile here would not
// be: it comes after its snippets, heredocs and {$NAME}, from any depth
// of import. What it does not see is a glob that matches something and
// misses something else: a wildcard directory with a link out beside
// real ones.
//
// It does not have the environment motel adapts it in, and is not
// given it: that environment is where the server's secrets are. But the
// Caddyfile's own {$NAME} is substituted in the text by whoever adapts,
// before any module sees a token, and that matters twice.
//
// A variable with no default, unset, leaves nothing where its value
// would be, and `email {$ACME_EMAIL}` is then a parse error: the most
// ordinary production Caddyfile does not adapt in an empty environment
// [measured; set to an empty string it fails the same way]. So every
// such variable is given a placeholder — a made-up value, of whichever
// kind the adapter accepts there. The structure of what is adapted is
// the server's own; only those values differ, and none of them is
// anywhere a plan looks.
//
// Unless one is: a root or a backup path written with a variable means
// one thing to the server and another here, and the difference would
// show up as an app with "no data yet", for ever. So every variable is
// then given a second value, and if the plan comes out different, Make
// refuses, naming it. One that no second value adapts with is refused
// where a trial failed at an import: that is what
// `import sites/{$ENV:prod}.caddy` looks like from here, and the file
// the server imports may say anything. Where every trial was refused
// by a directive checking its argument's form — `protocols
// {$TLS_MIN:tls1.2}`, an `lb_policy`, a `redir` code — the trials say
// nothing of where else the variable is written, so each place it is
// written is tried on its own (probe): a copy of the Caddyfile with
// that one occurrence made a value of its own and the others their
// defaults, adapted by the adapter. One the adapter refuses, quoting
// the value, is the directive's own; one that adapts and changes the
// plan is refused as a root's or a backup path's would be; and when
// none does either, the variable moves nothing a run does (#394). Caddy
// substitutes {$NAME} in the text before it reads a token, by the
// shape of match envRe is, so the occurrences found here are the ones
// it substitutes, whatever line, heredoc or quoted string they are in.
// Words that are neither the parser's about an import nor a
// directive's own are refused as before.
//
// What this does not show: the substitution is textual, so a value
// with a newline in it is more lines of Caddyfile, and can declare a
// backup the file does not [measured]. Every value tried here is one
// token; no set of them shows that no value restructures the file, and
// the server's values are not known here. A declaration that exists
// only through the server's environment is not in the plan.
