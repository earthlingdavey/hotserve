# motel package pre-remove: stop the service if systemd manages it —
# but only on actual removal (`remove`, including `remove in-favour`
# when a conflicting package replaces this one). dpkg also runs this
# script on upgrades (prerm upgrade <new-version>); stopping there would
# take the server down for the whole unpack and leave it disabled.
# Upgrades instead restart into the new binary in postinstall — and the
# deployed apps, which live under the motel user's own systemd
# manager, keep serving right through that restart. `deconfigure` is
# not removal either: dpkg runs it when a package being installed
# Breaks motel or one of its dependencies (dbus, libpam-systemd,
# swapped out during a dist-upgrade), the package stays installed, and postinstall's later `configure` only
# try-restarts — nothing would re-enable a torn-down box.
# An upgrade leaves the backup units alone (the owner, 2026-09-27): a
# run or a drill under way goes on as the program it was started as,
# and its upload, which is restic's, finishes. The helpers it starts
# from then on are the new version's, and each does nothing for a
# command of another version, saying so.
#
# stop_backups: at a remove, the timers and the services, stopped as
# dh_installsystemd stops them (the owner, 2026-09-27); then, while the
# program is still there, `motel-backup sweep`: the engine's own
# sweep of what a killed command left — its units, by the names it
# recorded, and what it left mounted under /run/motel-backup, made
# private and taken away — under the run lock, as the next command
# would have, since there will be none. A command that holds the lock
# — from a shell, or a service that did not stop — is left to run,
# and the sweep says so in the lock's own words.
